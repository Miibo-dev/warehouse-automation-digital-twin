## Overview

This repository showcases my work in intralogistics and warehouse 
automation. I have worked on a variety of projects, including:
- AMR/AGV fleet optimization and simulation
- Digital twin and digital shadow implementations
- Virtual commissioning for robotic systems
- Data-driven performance optimization
