## Overview

This repository showcases my work in intralogistics and warehouse 
automation. I have worked on a variety of projects, including:
- AMR/AGV fleet optimization and simulation
- Digital twin and digital shadow implementations
- Virtual commissioning for robotic systems
- Data-driven performance optimization

## Key Achievements

- **90% reduction** in simulation development time (months → days)
- **20% efficiency gains** through continuous improvement projects
- **35+ production simulations** delivered across warehouse automation, fleet/traffic management, and robotics integration

## Featured Projects
