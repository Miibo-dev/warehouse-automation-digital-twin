# Fleet Sizing & Optimization

Comprehensive fleet sizing and traffic management simulation for AMR deployments.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing fleet sizing and traffic management for Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) deployments in warehouse and intralogistics environments.

## Key Results

- Optimized fleet sizing and traffic management for AMR deployments
- Identified critical bottlenecks through heatmap analysis
- Reduced project commissioning time by up to 10%

## Methodology

1. **Real plant data analysis** - Collected and analyzed operational data from existing deployments
2. **Workflow implementation** - Developed simulation models based on worst-case scenarios and stress testing
3. **Traffic logic optimization** - Implemented intelligent routing and job prioritization
4. **KPI analysis** - Analyzed performance metrics to identify optimization opportunities
5. **Validation** - Validated simulation results against real-world performance

## Technologies Used

- AMR/AGV fleet simulation
- Traffic management algorithms
- Heatmap analysis for bottleneck identification
- Digital Model/Digital Shadow concepts

## Outcomes

The simulation-based approach enabled:
- Data-driven fleet sizing decisions
- Proactive identification of traffic bottlenecks
- Reduced commissioning time through virtual validation
- Optimized traffic management strategies
